# Marketing App - Java EE Databases 2 Project
This repository contains the code for the project for databases 2 course. It consisted in creating an application in which users can register to compile questionnaires about products on the website. There are two types of users: those of can compile the questionnaire and those of create questionnaires. The more questionnaires the user completes, the more points the user will have. There is also a leaderboard in which users can see their placement in the ranking.
